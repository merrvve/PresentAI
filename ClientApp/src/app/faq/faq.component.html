            <strong>Q: What is the main purpose of PresentAI tool?<br /></strong>
            A: The main purpose of PresentAI is to create a quick template for the presentation that users are preparing, which they can edit later. While preparing slides from plain text, PresentAI can perform time-consuming tasks such as sentence shortening, organizing them into relevant slides, and generating suitable titles within a few minutes. Presenters are responsible for adding the desired pictures and graphics. The functionality to add pictures and graphics directly through PresentAI is planned for future versions.

            <strong>Q: Is the PresentAI tool free to use? <br /></strong>
            A: Yes, our presentation maker tool is completely free to use. You can create and download presentations without any cost or subscription fees.

          <p>
            <strong>Q: How does the PresentAI summarize text? <br /></strong>
            A: Our presentation maker tool leverages the power of OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to analyze and summarize the inputted text. It identifies key ideas, important facts, and critical arguments, condensing them into concise bullet points and visually engaging slides.

          <p>
            <strong>Q: Is there a limit to the amount of text I can input? <br /></strong>
            A: Yes, the current limit to the amount of text is 6000 characters. We recommend keeping your text within reasonable bounds for optimal summarization results. You can part your text input to work better. Extremely lengthy texts might require additional processing time, and the summarization may not be as precise.
          </p>
          <p>

            <strong>Q: Can I download the presentations created with the presentation maker tool? <br /></strong>
            A: Yes, once you click on 'Create slides' button, download process starts automatically when the presentation is ready. The file is generated in .pptx file format and ready to use.

          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Q: Will I achieve better results if I create a presentation using the same text again?<br /></strong>

            A: When generating a presentation using the same text input, the newly created presentation will differ from previous attempts. The quality of the presentation may vary based on the efficiency of OpenAI API's summarization and slide rendering processes. It's important to note that making multiple attempts may decrease throughput and could potentially result in delayed responses or no response from the OpenAI API for a period of time. We recommend optimizing your content and exploring customization options to achieve the best possible presentation quality.

            <strong>
              Q: What does the "Error occurred while contacting OpenAI. Please retry after a few minutes." error message mean?<br />
            </strong>
            A: This error message indicates that Presentai is currently unable to receive a response from the OpenAI API. It could be due to a high volume of requests, resulting in the API being busy or experiencing delays. It is also possible that multiple requests are pending simultaneously, causing a temporary interruption in the connection. We recommend waiting a few minutes and retrying the operation to see if the issue resolves.

            <strong>
              Q: What does the " Error occured while generating slides. Please try again." error message mean?<br />
            </strong>
            A: This error message indicates that the slide content was generated successfully, but an error occurred while attempting to insert the content into the .pptx file. This issue may arise from challenges in converting the result content from the OpenAI API into the desired format for PresentAI. It is anticipated that this error will be resolved in the next attempt.

              Q: What can I do to create presentations at the optimum quality level? <br />
            </strong>
            A: To ensure presentations of the highest quality, we recommend keeping your text as concise as possible and utilizing well-written content. By condensing your ideas and using clear and impactful language, you can create presentations that effectively communicate your message to your audience.

            <strong>
              Q: Can I customize the generated presentations? <br />
            </strong>
            A: Absolutely! While the presentation maker tool automates the summarization and slide generation process, we understand the importance of personalization. You can easily customize the generated slides by modifying colors, fonts, layouts, and images to align with your branding or personal style.
